* Lists
Sometimes you want numbered lists: 

1. One 
2. Two 
3. Three 

Sometimes you want to bullet points: 
* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively, 

- Dashes work just as well 
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star: 
  - Likethis 
  - And this

* Images 
if you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

* Code 
There are many different ways to code with Github's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: 
`var example = true`. if you've got a longer block of code, you indent with four spaces: 

	if(isAwesome){
	return True
	}

Github also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation: 
```
if(isAwesome){
return True
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:
```javascript
if(isAwesome){
return True
}
```
